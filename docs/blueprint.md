## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 67%, 50% (a shade of blue), or RGB hex #2980B9, to evoke a sense of trust and intelligence.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 95% (very light blue), or RGB hex #F0F8FF, to create a clean, calming backdrop.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 53%, 45% (a shade of teal), or RGB hex #45B39D, to highlight interactive elements and important information.
- Headline Font: 'Poppins', sans-serif. Body Font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. 'Poppins' is used for headings, with 'PT Sans' used for body text, to provide a clear hierarchy with a blend of modernity and readability.
- Use a set of modern and simple icons, providing visual cues for navigation and actions. Consistent line thickness and a restricted color palette (primary and accent colors) will maintain a professional appearance.
- Employ a clean, responsive layout, adapting to different screen sizes. Use a grid system to align elements and ensure consistency across the platform. Incorporate whitespace to avoid clutter and enhance readability.
- Subtle transitions and animations on button hovers and page transitions to create a sense of interactivity and polish.
